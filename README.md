# RF-based-Drone-Surveillance-with-DL
This repository provides the Matlab code, including the dataset after pre-processing with data normalization and data reorganization, of an RF-based drone surveillance approach, in which the deep learning technique with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architecture is exploited to deal with different supervised learning tasks, including drone detection, drone type classification, and operation mode recognition. 

The code package consists of (1) **DroneRF** dataset, (2) Matlab code of network design and model learning.
The original database of DroneRF can be found
