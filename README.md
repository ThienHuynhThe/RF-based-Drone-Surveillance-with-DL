# RF-based-Drone-Surveillance-with-DL
The repository provides the Matlab code, including the dataset after pre-processing with data normalization and data reorganization, of an RF-based drone surveillance approach, in which the deep learning technique with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architecture is developed to deal with different supervised learning tasks, including drone detection, drone type classification, and operation mode recognition. 

This repository is associated with a research work that is being reviewed by IEEE Access for publication, therefore the access is limited for some sections.
We apologize for this inconvenience. A full access without barrier will be allowed in near future.

The code package consists of (1) **DroneRF** dataset, (2) Matlab code of network design and model learning.

**Note**:The original database of DroneRF is officially released [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f4c2b4n755/1).
